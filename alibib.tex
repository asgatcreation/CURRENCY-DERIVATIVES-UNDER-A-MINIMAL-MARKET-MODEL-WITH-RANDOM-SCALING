\section{ABSTRACT}
\begin{frame}{ABSTRACT}
\noindent
\par This project proposes an alternative, simple stochastic volatility model to describe the dynamics of a currency market for the pricing and hedging of derivatives. The time transformed squared Bessel processes are the fundamental driving variables in the minimal market model. The temporal transformation is defined by a random scale, which allows for realistic exchange rate dynamics. The price of popular European options is looked into. The model produces implied volatility surfaces that are similar to those seen in real markets, as shown.

\section{GENERAL INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{Background of Study}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Introduction}
\noindent
\par Warren Buffett memorably described derivatives as ``financial weapons of mass
destruction''. The much vaunted - and maligned - financial products have become a dirty
word in the popular press. But without them, financial markets and the world as we
know it simply wouldn't work. Derivatives were first instruments developed to secure the
supply of commodities and facilitate trade as well as to insure farmers against crop
failures. Over time, derivatives started to serve in addition other purposes such as a
source of funding but also the search for quick profits. From history it shows that
derivatives were regulated from the very beginning.\\
The degree of regulation of derivatives varied over the years, among jurisdictions and
depended on, for example, the political but also religious contexts. Some forms of
derivatives were banned and later allowed or the other way round. The history of
derivatives also provides evidence that the first derivatives markets were ``over-the-
counter'' (OTC). However, negotiating and contracting mostly took place at specific
locations, which, early in the history of derivatives, already displayed various
characteristics of organised derivatives markets. Derivatives exchanges came later, but
once established, trading of derivatives mainly occurred on their premises. The trend
only reversed in the early 1990s.
\end{frame}

%\subsection{The Origin of Derivatives}
\begin{frame}{The Origin of Derivatives}

\noindent
\par ``If any one owes a debt for a loan, and a storm prostrates the grain, or the harvest
fail, or the grain does not grow for lack of water; in that year he need not give his creditor
any grain, he washes his debt-tablet in water and pays no rent for the year.''\\
This text is the 48th law out of 282 contained in the Code of Hammurabi. Hammurabi was
a king of Babylon who reigned, according to some sources, from around 1792 to 1750 BC.
Hammurabi engraved the eponymous code on stone steles. This code counts among the
oldest written body of laws known today and covers almost all the aspects of civil as well
as commercial laws of that time. It deals to a great extent with contractual matters,
establishing for example the wages to be paid to an ox-driver or to a doctor. It is
renowned to be the most complete code of the Mesopotamian laws that have been
conserved until today.
\end{frame}

%\subsection{The Influence of Roman Law on Derivatives}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{The Influence of Roman Law on Derivatives}
\noindent
\par The Roman Era was not a land of welcome for derivatives, at least not at the
beginning. However, commercial realities imposed the use of contracts for future
deliveries. Pompey, military and political leader of the late Roman Republic, realised that
long-term planning was necessary in order to secure the supply of food for the growing
city of Rome, and he allowed private grain merchants to contract for periods of years.
The Romans also organized commodity markets with specific locations and fixed times to
facilitate trading throughout their territories.\\
Under Roman law, two types of forwards could be identified. The first was a promise for
future delivery of goods at the delivery date and the second was a purchase of
expectancy has a Roman lawyer wrote in the 2nd century AD. The legal difference
between the two was that the first was void if the delivery of goods failed to materialise,
but the second was valid even if the seller could not deliver on the promise. In this case,
Roman law would enforce the intentions of the parties, even if they were speculative. (Edward J. Swan, 2000).

\end{frame}

%\subsection{Derivatives in the Middle Ages}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Derivatives in the Middle Ages}
\noindent
\par In the Middle Ages, derivatives continued to be an instrument facilitating trade.
One early example of derivatives is a form of commander which was used by Italian
merchants from the 10th century on. Commanders were a kind of commercial
partnership contract for sea or land ventures. One partner put up the money, whereas
the other travelled on the venture. Many of these contracts could be considered as
commodity forward contracts, as in exchange of the invested capital, the ``venture''
agreed to acquire specified commodities.\\
Another example of derivatives is the monti share. Monti shares were issued by Italian
merchant cities in order to raise money. These shares were promises by the governments
to repay debts in the future. It began as the sale of future government revenues to
investors. By the 13th century, these shares were traded in secondary markets and were
even used as a means of payment for goods or services instead of cash. Because they
perfectly fungible, these shares were the ideal instrument to develop contracts markets.
However, these shares could not be sold freely, in particular to foreigners, and prices
fluctuated with the fortunes of the cities.\\
The bill of exchange is another example of a derivative. Long-distance trade relied on bills
of exchange as a medium of exchange. They were promises to pay back a specific amount
of money in a different location, in a different currency, and at a later period. Bills of
exchange resulted in both a credit and a change operation, which were inextricably
intertwined. As trade flourished, so did the exchange business, and professional money
changers and bill traders arose. The bills' owners may either keep them until they
matured or sell them to third parties in order to profit. They took the place of sending
gold or silver coins, which were sometimes out of stock, in transactions.

\end{frame}

%\subsection{The Origin of Derivatives}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Financial Innovation and the Rise of Modern OTC Derivatives}

\noindent
\par From the 1970s on, the USA has been the cradle of innovation in derivatives. The
development of computers and their growing use in finance, which allowed complex
models and computations to be quickly solved, but also the lenient regulatory regime
constituted key elements for innovation. Exchanges were the first to implement financial
innovations. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced financial
instrument futures contracts in 1972, while the Chicago Board of Trade introduced
interest rate futures contracts in 1975.\\
In the early 1980s, financial advancements in OTC derivatives were made. A Wall Street
investment bank issued the first collateralized debt obligations in the second part of the
1980s. However, for a short time, derivatives trading was mostly conducted on
exchanges. The notional value of OTC derivatives trading has already surpassed that of
exchange-traded derivatives by 1991.\\
The 1990s saw the creation of modern credit default swaps, and roughly a decade later $\cdots$
the subprime mortgage crisis, which will definitely leave an indelible mark on derivatives
history.( Sources: Edward J. Swan, Building the Global Market).
\end{frame}

\subsection{Objectives of the Study}
\begin{frame}{Objectives of the Study}
\noindent 
\par The main goal of the Currency Derivatives project is to learn about the currency futures
and options markets.
\begin{itemize}
\item To investigate the parsimonious stochastic volatility model

\item To comprehend the dynamics of a currency market for the pricing and hedging of
derivatives.

\item To study the pricing of standard European options

\item To investigate the time transformed squared Bessel processes which are the basic
driving factors of the minimal market model.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Currency derivatives}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Currency derivatives}
\noindent
\par A currency in the most specific sense is money in any form when it is in use or
circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more
general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use, especially for
people in a nation.\\
Currency derivatives are contracts to buy or sell currencies at a future date. The major
types of currency derivatives are forward contracts, futures contracts, options and swaps.\\
A derivative is a financial security with a value that is reliant upon or derived from, an
underlying asset or group of assets - a benchmark. The derivative itself is a contract
between two or more parties, and the derivative derives its price from fluctuations in the
underlying asset. Stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market
indexes are the most prevalent underlying assets for derivatives. Brokerages are
frequently used to purchase these assets.\\
Over-the-counter (OTC) or on an exchange, derivatives can be traded. OTC derivatives
account for a larger share of the derivatives market. In general, OTC-traded derivatives
have a higher risk of counterparty risk. The possibility of one of the transaction's parties
defaulting is known as counterparty risk. These parties are unregulated and trade
between two private parties. Exchange-traded derivatives, on the other hand, are more
standardized and regulated.

\end{frame}

\subsection{The Basics of a Derivative}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{The Basics of a Derivative}
\noindent
\par Derivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the direction of an
underlying asset's movement, or provide holdings more leverage. Their worth is
determined by the underlying asset's price movements.\\
\par Derivatives were first employed to ensure that items traded globally had balanced
exchange rates. International traders needed a mechanism to account for the disparities
in national currencies' values. Derivatives are now based on a wide range of transactions
and have a wide range of applications. Weather-related derivatives, such as the amount
of rain or the number of sunny days in a location, are also available.\\
For example, imagine a European investor, whose investment accounts are all
denominated in euros (EUR). This investor purchases shares of a U.S. company through a
U.S. exchange using U.S. dollars (USD). Now the investor is exposed to exchange-rate risk
while holding that stock. Exchange-rate risk is the threat that the value of the euro will
increase in relation to the USD. If the value of the euro rises, any profits the investor
realizes upon selling the stock become less valuable when they are converted into euros.\\
\par The investor could adopt a currency derivative to lock in a specific exchange rate to
control the risks. Currency futures and currency swaps are two derivatives that could be
used to hedge this type of risk. A speculator who believes the euro will rise in value
against the dollar can make profit by using a derivative that rises in value with the euro.\\
The investor does not need to have a holding or portfolio presence in the underlying
asset when employing derivatives to speculate on its price movement.

\end{frame}

\subsection{Common Forms of Derivatives}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Common Forms of Derivatives}
\begin{description}
\item[Futures contracts] are financial derivatives that oblige the buyer to
purchase some underlying asset (or the seller to sell that asset) at a predetermined
future price and date. It allows an investor to use leverage to bet on the direction of an
asset, commodity, or financial instrument.\\
\par Suppose that on November 6, 2019, Company-A purchases a futures contract for
oil at a price of \textdollar62.22 per barrel with an expiration date of December 19, 2019. This is
because the company requires oil in December and is anxious that the price will increase
before it can purchase it. Because the seller on the other side of the deal is required to
supply oil to Company-A for \textdollar62.22 per barrel once the contract has expired, buying an
oil futures contract hedges the company's risk. Assume that oil prices will reach \textdollar80 per
barrel by December 19, 2019. Company-A can accept delivery of the oil from the futures
contract seller, but if it no longer requires it, it can sell the contract before it expires and
keep the profits. Both the futures buyer and seller may have been hedging risk in this
situation.
\item[Forward Contracts] are similar to futures, however they are traded over - 
the - counter rather than on an exchange. When a forward contract is made, the terms,
size, and settlement mechanism for the derivative may be specified by the buyer and
seller. Forward contracts pose a higher level of counterparty risk for both buyers and
sellers because they are OTC products. Counterparty risks are a type of credit risk in
which the buyer or seller may be unable to fulfil the contract's commitments. If one of
the contracting parties goes bankrupt, the other party may be left with no redress and
may lose the value of its position.\\
\par A forward contract's partners can offset their positions with other counterparties
once it's been made, which might increase the danger of counterparty risk as additional
traders get involved in the same contract.
\item[Swaps] are frequently used to convert one type of cash flow into another.
An interest rate swap, for example, could be used by a trader to go from a variable
interest rate loan to a fixed interest rate loan, or vice versa.
\item[Options: ] An options contract is similar to a futures contract in that it
involves two parties agreeing to buy or sell an asset at a certain price at a future date.
The main distinction between options and futures is that with an option, the buyer is not
obligated to carry out their buy or sale agreement. It is merely an opportunity, not an
obligation; commitments are made in the future. Options, like futures, can be used to
hedge or speculate on the underlying asset's price.

\subsection{Introduction to Black Scholes model (BSM)}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Introduction to Black Scholes model (BSM)}
\noindent
\par The black-Scholes model is a mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market
containing derivative investment instruments. The BSM accepts an equal risk neutral
martingale measure, allowing for straightforward application of the usual risk neutral
pricing approach. The volatilities of exchange rates in currency markets are not
deterministic, as has been demonstrated in a variety of research. ( A.M Malz, 1997) for
example. This is also reflected in deviations of observed derivative prices from the prices
predicted under the BSM. Therefore, it is essential to provide reliable prices and hedging
prescriptions for a range of derivative securities.\\
Multiplying the stock price by the cumulative standard normal probability distribution
function yields the Black-Scholes call option formula. The strike price's net present value
(NPV) multiplied by the cumulative standard normal distribution is then subtracted from
the preceding calculation's result.
In mathematical notation:
$$
C = S_tN(d_1) - Ke^{-rt}N(d_2)
$$
\textbf{where:}
$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln\frac{S_t}{K}+\bigg(r+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2}\bigg)t}{\sigma_s\sqrt{t}}
$$
and

$$
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma_s\sqrt{t}
$$
\textbf{where:}
$C = $ Call option price\\
$S = $ Current stock (or other underlying) price\\
$K = $ Strike price\\
$r = $ Risk - free interest rate\\
$t = $ Time to maturity\\

\subsection{A Minimal Market Model (MMM)}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{A Minimal Market Model (MMM)}
\noindent
\par Eckhard Platern (2001) said an advanced financial market model should be analytically
tractable and must reflect with a minimal number of factors essential stylised empirical
facts. It must work equally well for derivative pricing and hedging as well as for risk
measurement and portfolio management. All factors in such a market model should
represent directly interpretable or observable quantities.\\
\par The well-known Black-Scholes model (BSM) assumes that geometric Brownian
motions generate the asset price dynamics. Although the theoretical and practical
importance of the BSM cannot be underestimated, it is far from being satisfactory. The
BSM has the drawback that it assumes deterministic volatility. This does not match
historically observed stochastic volatility. For instance, in the context of option pricing,
practitioners have to correct for implied volatility skews and smiles due to stochastic
volatility. The at the money short term implied volatility of an index has typically a strong
negative correlation with the index itself, which is also known as the leverage effect.
Furthermore, it has been observed that log-returns of indices over long time periods tend
to be Gaussian distributed. On the other hand, short term log-returns of asset prices have
been shown to be leptokurtic with specific distributional properties. These stylised
empirical facts should be well reflected in a sophisticated financial market model. Such a
model should also acknowledge natural symmetries that exist in a benchmarked market.\\
\par The minimum market model (MMM) proposed by (Platen, 2001) models exchange
rates as squared Bessel process ratios in a parsimonious and consistent manner. (Heath
and Platen, 2002) point out that because the resulting currency model is a generalization
of the MMM, it does not allow for the existence of an equivalent risk neutral martingale
measure. As a result, we use the fair pricing idea of the benchmark approach introduced
by (Platen, 2002) to obtain a consistent arbitrage-free pricing framework. We study the
dynamics of various denominations of the growth optimal portfolio (GOP), which is
defined as the portfolio that maximizes projected logarithmic utility. The ratio of two
GOP currency denominations is then used to calculate an exchange rate.

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Properties of the MMM}
    \noindent
\par The $MMM$ generates stochastic volatility without the use of an external volatility
process. Volatilities are proportional to the square root of inverted square root
processes. This feature causes negative correlation between the jth denomination of the
$BBP$ and its volatility. Since the $BBP$ is like an index, the $MMM$ generates a leverage effect
as is typically observed for indices but also for equities. The resulting volatility process
exhibits natural persistence and generates threshold exceedances of log returns that are
clustered and have leptokurtic distributions that are similar to those observed in reality.\\
\par Under the $MMM$ log-returns of the $BBP$ over long time intervals are, in principle,
characterised by the corresponding Gaussian growth rates "Ii and thus are essentially
Gaussian distributed. This matches the widely observed Gaussianity of long term log-returns.\\
\par Since the leverage effect is modelled naturally by the $MMM$, implied volatility
skews for European puts and calls on stock indices, stocks and currencies match those
observed in practice, we can see this in (Heath, D. \& E. Platen , 2000).\\
\par The $MMM$ in its version with constant parameters provides a good fit to real data.
For example, movements in the at-the-money implied volatility are naturally captured by
movements in the underlying factor, see (Heath, D. \& E. Platen , 2000). In addition all of
the parameters in the model can be estimated almost directly from observed quantities.
Another important advantage of the model is its computational tractability due to the
fact that the transition densities of the factors have an explicit form.

\end{frame}
\section{LITERATURE REVIEW}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Introduction}
    \noindent
\par Financial derivative has been described as a popular instrument used by financial
institution for mitigating risks and possible loss (Lenee \& Oki, 2017). It is used for hedging
against risks and sometimes for speculation purpose. All derivatives in deposit money
banks are classified as derivatives held for trading and risk management purposes.
Derivative held for trading may be derivative instruments trade by banks on its own
behalf or a sometimes on behalf of customers or both. The term 	`derivative' can be linked
to the English word `derive' that is, to obtain or attain something from something else.
They are instrument that does not have value of its own but derive its value from the
value of another thing. Afolabi and Olaoye (2017) defined derivative as a contract which
describe the rights and obligations of two parties to receive or deliver future cash flows
which may be an exchange of other securities or assets but based on some future events
while Osayi, Kasimu and Nkwonta (2018) described it as contracts whose value is
determine by the value of one or more underlying assets. They are used to hedge risks
associated with the instruments on which they have been derived.\\

\par Derivatives, according to Osuoha, Martin, and Osuoha (2015), are financial
products whose value is derived from the value of another instrument. Financial
derivatives and commodity derivatives are two types of derivatives. Financial derivatives
are formed from instruments like interest rates, exchange rates, shares, bonds, and
treasury bills, whereas commodity derivatives are derived from agricultural products,
precious metals, oil, and gas, among others. Financial derivatives are financial
instruments that derive its value from another financial instrument through which an
identified risk is tradable in the financial market. It is an instrument that its price is linked
with another underlying asset. They serve as risk management tool used by banks to
curtail unforeseen circumstances that may hinder their desirable profit (Osayi, Kasimu
and Nkwonta, 2018). In same vein, Osayi, Kasimu and Nkwonta (2018) describes financial
derivatives as a financial instrument linked to a definite financial instrument or
commodity, through which specific financial risk can be traded in the financial market.
Banks therefore enter into various forms of financial derivatives instruments in order to manage risks related to interest rate, foreign exchange rate including foreign exchange
forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.\\

\par Financial derivatives are divided into four categories. Forwards, futures, options,
and swaps are the four types of derivatives (Fadun, 2013; Afolabi \& Olaoye, 2017; Lenee
\& Oki, 2017). A forward contract is an agreement between two (2) people, referred to as
buyers and sellers, to buy or sell at a specific price and on a specific date in the future. It
is the most basic type of derivative in which a buyer and seller agree today to buy or sell
a specified underlying asset at a predetermined price and at a future date. When a
forward contract is signed, the price is agreed today, but the asset is not delivered until
later. The buyer in forward contract assume a long position as he/she agrees to buy at a
predetermined price in a future date while the seller assumes a short position as he/she
agrees to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price in a future date.
Exchange-Traded Derivatives (ETDs), Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and Over-the-
Counter Derivatives are all ways to trade derivatives. ETDs are recognized derivatives
traded on a recognized exchange platform. Their prices are public knowledge, and their
terms are not negotiable. ETFs are investment vehicles that help investors track the
performance of underlying assets. They involve trading of shares on the exchange and
derive value from the underlying asset they track. OTCs on the other hand are bespoke
contract designed to suit the participants need. They have predetermined terms agreed
upon by the parties involved and can be exchanged without an intermediary.\\
\par In March 2011, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a guideline for FX derivatives in
the Nigerian financial market, in response to global adoption of derivative markets and in
an effort to ensure financial stability and smooth derivative trade. The guidelines detailed
the allowed derivative products, as well as prudential guidelines and trade-backed
requirements. FX options, FX forwards (both deliverable and non-deliverable), and
Trading liquidity in cross-currency interest rate swaps are all authorized derivatives.
Authorized dealers can use both call and put options, according to the regulation (CBN, 2011).\\

\par Financial derivatives play a crucial role in minimizing risk and maximizing expected
return, which is supported by contemporary portfolio theory (MPT).\\
Through his work on portfolio selection, Harry Markowitz proposed the hypothesis in
1952. It stressed the effective use of portfolios in order to optimize return on investment
at a given risk level. It requires that investors are risk averse, rational, and have equal
access to information, as well as that returns are regularly distributed. MPT emphasizes
diversification and risk assessment in order to obtain a desired return, which serves as a
foundation for financial derivatives as a risk management tool. Rivas (2006) studied
whether the use of derivatives increase bank efficiency: evidence from Latin American
banks. It employs envelopment and regression analysis and focuses on all Latin American
banks, finding that the use of derivatives improves the efficiency of Brazilian, Chilean, and
Mexican banks. The effects of the use of derivatives on financial performance of
companies listed in the Nairobi security exchange was studied by Chanzu and Gekaru
(2014) in Kenya. The study deployed survey design where questionnaires were
distributed to the finance officers of 11 companies listed on the Nairobi Security
Exchange. Correlation analysis was used to test the tested hypothesis which founds that
unlike price stabilization, risk management efficiency and price discovery had positive
contribution to financial performance of the listed companies studied.
Bendob, Bentouir and Bellaouar (2015) also conducted a research on the effect of
financial derivatives use on the performance of commercial banks: empirical study in GCC
Countries during 2000-2013. Nineteen (19) commercial banks in four (4) CC countries
between 2003 and 2013 were studied and following the hypothesis tested with the aid of
unbalanced panel regression model. The study suggests that the usage of financial
derivatives aids in the reduction of un systemic risks, which improves commercial bank
performance, particularly during times of crisis.\\

\par There is a rich literature on asset price modelling. For surveys on the modelling of
stochastic volatility and other empirical stylised facts in the context of asset price
dynamics (Frey, R. 1997). A well studied group of asset price models covers the
subordinated models, see, for instance, (Clark, P. K. 1973), (Hurst, S. R., E. Platen, \& S. T.
Rachev 1997), and (Heyde, C. C. 1999 ) to mention just a few. These models use non-decreasing stochastic processes, usually with independent increments, to generate an
independent stochastic operational time as directing process. A disadvantage of
subordinated asset price models is that they typically assume independence between an
asset price and the directing process. This means they have difficulties to model the
above mentioned leverage effect. It is highly desirable that at least an idealised version of
a financial market model should form a complete market. In ( Dupire, B. 1994) and
(Derman et al, 1994). Volatility function approaches are developed that lead to complete
market models. These are in some sense generalisations of the constant elasticity of
variance model.
\end{frame}
\subsection{Arbitrage pricing Theory}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Arbitrage pricing Theory}

\noindent
\par As an alternative to the capital asset pricing
model, arbitrage pricing theory attempts to explain asset or portfolio returns using
systematic factors and asset/portfolio sensitivity to such factors. The theory estimates
the expected returns of a well diversified portfolio with the underlying assumption that
portfolios are well-diversified and any discrepancy from the equilibrium price in the
market would be instantaneously driven away by investors. (Mark-Egart, Dorah
Budonyefa, 2020 ) Any difference between actual return and expected return is explained
by factor surprises (differences between expected and actual values of factors).\\

\par The disadvantage of arbitrage pricing theory is that it does not identify systematic
components; nevertheless, analysts can find them by regressing historical portfolio
returns against factors like real GDP growth rates, inflation, term structure changes, risk
premium changes, and so on. Regression equations can be used to determine which
systematic elements are responsible for portfolio results and which are not. Factor
models like the capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing theory can predict
security returns. It's worth noting that a portfolio's unsystematic risk must be mitigated
by a suitable number of securities. As with well-diversified portfolios, well-functioning
markets do not allow for the persistence of arbitrage opportunities, and violations of
equilibrium for any asset cannot be ruled out as in the Capital Asset Pricing model.\\

\par The Arbitrage Pricing implies that the return of an asset can be broken down into an
expected return and an unexpected or surprise component. Thus, the Arbitrage Pricing
Theory predicts that ``general news'' will affect the rate of return on all stocks but by
different amounts. In this regard, the Arbitrage Pricing Theory is more general than the
Capital Asset Pricing Model in that it permits a greater number of variables to influence
the rate of return (Cuthbertson, 2004).

\subsection{Three Underlying Assumptions of Arbitrage Pricing Theory}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Three Underlying Assumptions of Arbitrage Pricing Theory}
\noindent
\par Unlike the capital asset pricing model, arbitrage pricing theory does not assume that
investors hold efficient portfolios. The theory does, however, follow three underlying
assumptions: Asset returns are explained by systematic factors. Investors can build a
portfolio of assets where specific risk is eliminated through diversification. No arbitrage
opportunity exists among well-diversified portfolios. If any arbitrage opportunities do
exist, they will be exploited away by investors.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For a well-developed portfolio, a basic formula describing arbitrage pricing theory can be written as the following:
$$
E(R_p) = R_f+\beta_1f_1+\beta_2f_2+\cdots+\beta_nf_n
$$
where:\\
$E(R_p)$ = Expected return\\
$R_f$ = Risk - free return\\
$\beta_n$ = Sensitivity to the factor of $n$.\\
$f_n$ = $n^{\mbox{th}}$ factor price.\\

$R_f$ is the return if the asset did not have exposure to any factors, that is to say, all $\beta_n = 0$.\\
Unlike in the capital asset pricing model, the arbitrage pricing theory does not specify the factors. However, according to the research of Stephen Ross and Richard Roll, the most important factors are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Change in inflation.
\item Change in the level of Industrial production.
\item Shifts in Risk premiums.
\item Change in the shape of the term structure of interest rates.
\end{itemize}4.9335
Ross and Roll, still beleives if no surprize happens in the change of the above factors, the actual return will be equal to the expected return. However, in cae of unanticipated changes to the factors, the actual return will be defined as follows:
$$
R_p = E(R_p) + \beta_1f_1^\prime+\beta_2f_2^\prime +\cdots + \beta_nf_n^\prime +e
$$
where:\\
$f_n^\prime = $ The unanticipated change in the factor or surprise factor\\
$e = $ The residual part of actual return.

\subsection{Benchmarked Securities and Fair Pricing}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Benchmarked Securities and Fair Pricing}
\noindent
\par Using E. platen (2005) Under the benchmark approach, we call any price that is expressed in units of the GOP a benchmarked price. Thus, the benchmarked $j$th
savings account value $\hat{S}^{(j)}_t$ at time $t$ is obtained by the ratio


\begin{equation}\label{3.3.1}
\hat{S}_t^{(j)} = \frac{S_t^{0,j}}{D_t^0},
\end{equation}
for $t\in [0,T]$ and $j\in\{0,1,\ldots,d\}.$\\
By application of the Ito formula we obtain from \eqref{3.3.1}, %\eqref{3.10} and \eqref{3.5} for
the benchmarked $j$th savings account $\hat{S}_t^{(j)}$  the SDE

\begin{equation}\label{3.3.2}
d\hat{S}_t^{(j)} = -\hat{S}_t^{(j)}\sum_{k = 1}^d\theta_t^{j,k}dW_t^k,
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$, $j\in\{0,1,\ldots,d\}$.\\
Note that the SDE \eqref{3.3.2} for $\hat{S}_t^{(j)}$  is driftless and $\hat{S}(j)$ is therefore a
nonnegative $(\mathcal{\underline{A}}, P)$-local martingale, (Protter, 2004 and Platen, 2005) for $j \in \{0,
1,\ldots, d\}.$\\
Similarly, by application of the It$\hat{\mbox{o}}$ formula it follows  %from \eqref{3.5}, \eqref{3.9} and \eqref{3.6} 
 that any benchmarked portfolio
\begin{equation}\label{3.3.3}
\hat{S}_t^{(\delta)} = \frac{S_t^{(\delta)}}{D_t^0}
\end{equation}
is also driftless, that is
\begin{equation}\label{3.3.4}
d\hat{S}_t^{(\delta)} = \sum_{j = 0}^d\delta_t^jd\hat{S}_t^{(j)}
\end{equation}
for $t \in [0, T].$ This means that benchmarked portfolio processes are $(\mathcal{\underline{A}}, P)$ - local martingales. Consequently, any nonnegative benchmarked portfolio is an $(\mathcal{\underline{A}}, P)$ -
supermartingale, see Protter (2004). By using this property it is shown in (E. Platen, 2002 and 2005) that from zero initial capital one cannot generate, by
using any nonnegative self-financing portfolio, some strictly positive wealth with
strictly positive probability. In this sense, the above benchmark model is
arbitrage free.\\
The Radon-Nikodym derivative $\Lambda^{(j)} = \{\Lambda_t^{(j)},t\in[0,T]\}$, with

\begin{equation}\label{3.3.5}
\Lambda_t^{(j)} = \frac{\hat{S}_t^{(j)}}{\hat{S}_0^{(j)}},
\end{equation}

for $t \in [0, T]$ and $j \in \{0, 1,\ldots, d\}$, for the candidate risk neutral measure of the
jth currency denomination equals up to a constant factor the jth benchmarked savings account. By \eqref{3.3.2} the process $\Lambda^{(j)}$ is an $(\mathcal{\underline{A}}, P)$ - local martingale, $j \in \{0, 1,\ldots,d\}$. The majority of the work on currency derivative pricing assumes that all currency denominations have comparable risk neutral martingale measures. %Most of the literature on currency derivative pricing makes the
%assumption that there exist equivalent risk neutral martingale measures for all
%currency denominations. 
This means that one assumes that the Radon Nikodym derivatives $\Lambda^{(0)}, \Lambda^{(1)},\ldots,\Lambda^{(d)}$ of the corresponding candidate risk neutral
measures are for all currency denominations martingales.\\
%\textbf{D. Health and E. Platen (2005)} 
For a maturity date $T \in (0,\infty)$ let $H_T$ denote an
$A_T$ - measurable, nonnegative contingent claim, which is expressed in units of
the domestic currency and has finite expected benchmarked value, that is
\begin{equation}\label{3.3.6}
E\bigg(\frac{H_T}{D_T^0}\bigg|\mathcal{A}_t\bigg)<\infty,
\end{equation}
for all $t\in[0,T]$. The benchmarked, fair price $\hat{u}H_T(t)$ at time $t$ of this contingent claim is given by the conditional expectation

\begin{equation}\label{3.3.7}
\hat{u}H_T(t) = E\bigg(\frac{H_T}{D_T^0}\bigg|\mathcal{A}_t\bigg),
\end{equation}
for $t \in [0, T].$ This specification makes the benchmarked price process $\hat{u}H_t = \{\hat{u}H_T(t),~t\in[0,T]\}$  an $(\mathcal{\underline{A}}, P)$-martingale that matches the contingent claim $H_T$ at
the maturity date $T$ . Any nonnegative portfolio that replicates the contingent claim is %according to \eqref{3.4} and \eqref{3.3} 
 an $(\mathcal{A}, P)$-supermartingale. It has therefore
an initial value greater or equal to the fair value. The fair value describes in the
given currency benchmark model the minimal price that allows one to replicate
the contingent claim by a nonnegative portfolio, see Platen (2002).\\
The fair price $uH_T(t)$ of the contingent claim $H_T$ at time $t$, when expressed in units of the domestic currency, is then according to \eqref{3.3.3} obtained by the fair
pricing formula

\begin{equation}\label{3.3.8}
uH_T(t) = D^0_t\hat{u}H_T(t),
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$. An analogous formula holds for each currency denomination.\\
If there exists an equivalent risk neutral martingale measure $\tilde{P}$ with Radon-Nikodym derivative $\Lambda_T^{(0)} = \frac{d\tilde{P}}{dP}\bigg|\mathcal{A}_T = \frac{B_T^0}{D_T^0}D_0^0$ at time $t$, then the fair pricing formula coincides with the classical risk neutral pricing formula, as can be seen by the relations
\begin{equation}\label{3.3.9}
\begin{split}
uH_T(t) &= E\bigg(\frac{D_t^0}{D_T^0}\frac{B_T^0}{B_t^0}\frac{B_t^0}{B_T^0}H_T\bigg|\mathcal{A}_t\bigg) = E\bigg(\frac{\Lambda_T^0}{\Lambda_t^0}\frac{B_t^0}{B_T^0}H_T\bigg|\mathcal{A}_t\bigg) \\
&= \tilde{E}\bigg(\frac{B_t^0}{B_T^0}H_T\bigg|\mathcal{A}_t\bigg)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Therefore $\tilde{E}$ denotes expectation under the domestic equivalent risk neutral
martingale measure, see Platen (2002). However, as indicated previously, a
realistic currency benchmark model is unlikely to have an equivalent risk neutral
martingale measure. This is why we will use the fair pricing formula. \eqref{3.3.8}

\subsection{Minimal Market Model with Random Scaling}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Minimal Market Model with Random Scaling}
\noindent
\par The model under consideration here is a generalization of the minimal market model (MMM) proposed in %The model that we consider now is a generalization of the minimal market
%model (MMM) suggested in
(E. Platen, 2001 and 2002) . The MMM generates
stochastic volatilities that involve transformations of squared Bessel processes.
As discussed in (W. Breymann et al, 2005), the MMM captures a number of
important stylized empirical facts observed for indices and exchange rates.
Under the generalized version of the MMM that we considered, the $j$th denomination $D_t^j$ of the GOP at time $t \in [0, T ]$ is modelled by the equation
\begin{equation}\label{3.4.1}
D_t^j = \bigg(Z_t^j\bigg)^{\frac{\nu_j}{2}-1}B_t^j,
\end{equation}
where $Z^j = \{Z_t^j,~t\in[0,T]\}$ is a time transformed squared Bessel process of dimension $\nu_j>2$, which satisfies the SDE
\begin{equation}\label{3.4.2}
dZ_t^j = \frac{\nu_j}{4}\sum_{k = 1}^d\bigg(q_t^{j,k}\bigg)^2\gamma_tdt+\sqrt{Z_t^j\gamma_t}\sum_{k = 1}^dq_t^{j,k}dW_t^k,
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$ with $Z_0^j = (D_0^j)^{\frac{2}{\nu_j-2}}>0,~j\in\{0,1,\ldots\}$.\\
We know that the above time transformed squared Bessel process stays almost
surely strictly positive, See D. Revuz and M. Yor (1999).\\
\par The $(j,k)$th scaling level $q^{j,k} = \{q_t^{j,k},~t\in[0,T]\}$. In general, one could introduce a separate scaling for each squared Bessel process. However, for simplicity we consider  here only a single common scaling process $\gamma$. The scaling levels $q^{j,k}$ can, for instance, be modeled as continuous time Markov chains. For simplicity, we assume here that these are constants. \\

By application of the Ito formula, it follows from \eqref{3.4.1} and \eqref{3.4.2} that the $j$th
denomination $D^j_t$ of the GOP at time $t$ satisfies the SDE %\eqref{3.5} 
 with $(j, k)$th
volatility, that is $(j,k)$th market price of risk,

\begin{equation}\label{4.3}
\theta_t^{j,k} = \bigg(\frac{\nu_j}{2} - 1\bigg)q^{j,k}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_t}{Z_t^j}},
\end{equation}
for $t\in [0,T],~ j\in\{0,1,\ldots,d\},~k\in\{1,2,\ldots,d\}$. This volatility is stochastic since it is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the $j$th squared Bessel process $Z_j$. We allow the scaling $\gamma_t$ to be random to generate globally for the currency market random time transformations for the squared Bessel processes involved. One can say that the random scaling models the trading activity in the currency market. To model this in detail, we assume that the random scaling $\gamma_t$ satisfies the SDE
\begin{equation}\label{4.4}
d\gamma_t = a(t,\gamma_t)dt+b(t,\gamma_t)\bigg(\sum_{k = 1}^de^k dW_t^k+\sqrt{1-\sum_{k = 1}^d(e^k)^2d\tilde{W}_t}\bigg)
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$ with $\gamma_0\geq 0.$ Here $\tilde{W} = \{\tilde{W}_t,~~t\in [0,T]\}$ is an independent standard Wiener process that does not drive the trading noise of the market. Furthermore, the $k$th scaling correlation $\varrho^k$ is assued to be constant. The drift coefficient function $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ and the diffusion coefficient function $b(\cdot,\cdot)$ are given functions to be chosen such that the SDE \eqref{4.4} has a unique strong solution and the scaling $\gamma_t$ remains almost surely nonnegative for all $t\in[0,T]$.\\

\par The random scaling formulation presented above is still quite general. Further details based on empirical evidence will be provided below. Then, we get a Markovian multi-factor currency benchmark model. Only up to two or three dimensions do current numerical methods for derivative pricing problems work reasonably well. This is also the dimensionality of the model in question. Numerically, we are thus at the limit of what is possible with current algorithms and techniques.\\ %The above formulation of the random scaling is still rather general.

Current numerical methods applied to derivative pricing problems work reasonably well only up to two or three dimensions. This is also the dimensionality of the model considered here.Numerically, we are therefore on the borderline of what is achievable withcurrent algorithms and techniques.\\

\par As we will see below, when pricing currency options, the derivative prices are strongly influenced by the randomness in the scaling. To be more specific, we introduce the \emph{market activity process } $m = \{m_t,~t\in[0,T]\}$, see Breymann, Kelly and et al(2005), given by 
\begin{equation}\label{4.5}
m_t = \frac{\gamma_t}{\xi_t},
\end{equation}
with the exponential function

\begin{equation}\label{4.6}
\xi_t = \xi_0\exp\bigg\{\int_0^t\eta_sds\}
\end{equation}
for $t\in [0,T]$. Here $\xi_0>0$ is a constant and $\eta_t$ is the piecewise constant deterministic \emph{long term net growth rate} of the market. If one thinks of the market activity $m_t$ as fluctuating around one, then the net growth rate process $\eta = \{\eta_t\in[0,T]\}$ needs to offset the average growth in the random scaling $\gamma$ over the long term.\\
This is why the ratio $\frac{\gamma_t}{\xi_t}$ appears in \eqref{4.5}.\\

The market activity $m_t$ is designed to model the normalized trading activity at
time $t$. By using intraday data the market activity process for the US dollar
denomination has been analyzed in W. Breymann et al, (2005). According to
these results, a realistic market activity process is obtained when the diffusion
coefficient function in \eqref{4.4} is chosen to be multiplicative with

\begin{equation}\label{4.7}
b(t,\gamma) = \beta_t\gamma.
\end{equation}
for $(t,\gamma)\in[0,T]\times (0,\infty)$. In addition, these results suggest that the drift coefficient function has the form 

\begin{equation}\label{4.8}
a(t,\gamma_t) = \xi_t\beta_t^2A\bigg(\frac{\gamma_t}{\xi_t}\bigg)+\gamma_t\eta_t,
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$ and $\gamma\geq 0$, where the \emph{activity volatility} $\beta = \{\beta_t, ~t\in[0,T]\}$ is some deterministic function of time. Using Ito's formula together with \eqref{4.4}, \eqref{4.5} and \eqref{4.6} the  SDE for $m_t$ is given by

$$
dm_t = \beta_t^2 A(m_t)dt+\beta_tm_t\bigg(\sum_{k = 1}^d\varrho^kdW_t^k+\sqrt{1-\sum_{k = 1}^d(\varrho^k)^2d\tilde{W}_t}\bigg),
$$
for $t\in[0,T]$.\\

The particular choice of the function $A(\cdot)$ controls the type of feedback which characterizes the random scaling. W. Breymann et al, (2005) pointed out that a good choice for the function $A(\cdot)$ is of the form

\begin{equation}\label{4.9}
A(m) = \bigg(\frac{p}{2}-\frac{g}{2}m\bigg)m.
\end{equation}

For $m\in[0,\infty)$, with some speed of adjustment parameter $g$ and some reference level $p$. It is possible to demonstrate that the market activity process has %The market activity process can be shown to have 
the gamma density as its stationary density with mean $\frac{p-1}{g}$ and variance $\frac{1}{g}$ for parameters  $g>0$ and $p>1$, (Heath and Platen, 2004).

% \begin{equation}\label{5.2}
% dD_t^i = D_t^i\bigg(\bigg(r_t^i+\bigg(\frac{\nu_i - 2}{2}\bigg)^2(q^{i,i+1})^2\frac{\gamma_t}{Z_t^i}\bigg)dt+\frac{\nu_i - 2}{2}q^{i,i+1}\bigg(\frac{\gamma_t}{Z_t^i}\bigg)^{\frac{1}{2}}dW_t^{i+1}\bigg),

 the fair price $P_{T,K}(t,D_t^0,D_t^1, \gamma_t)$ for a European put option with strike $K$ and maturity date $T$ is given by

\begin{equation}\label{6.6}
P_{T,K}(t,D_t^0,D_t^1,\gamma_t) = D_t^0E\bigg(\bigg(\frac{K}{D_T^0} - \frac{1}{D_T^1}\bigg)^+\bigg|\mathcal{A}_t\bigg),
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$, the corresponding put-call parity relation between European put and call options is expressed via the equation

\begin{equation}\label{6.7}
P_{T,K}(t,D_t^0,D_t^1,\gamma_t) = C_{T,K}(t,D_t^0,D_t^1, \gamma_t)+KP_T^0(t,D_t^0,\gamma_t) - P_T^1(t,D_t^0, D_t^1, \gamma_t)
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$.\\
Let us now define the time transformation $\varphi$ by the differential

\begin{equation}\label{6.8}
d\varphi(t) = \gamma_tdt
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$ with $\varphi(0) = 0$. Consider the time transformed stochastic process $V^i = \{V^i_{\varphi},~\varphi\in[0,\varphi(T)]\}$ given by 

\begin{equation}\label{4.2.9}
V_{\varphi(t)}^i = Z_t^i,
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$ and $i\in\{0,1\}$. Using %\eqref{4.1},
\eqref{6.8} and \eqref{4.2.9} it can be seen that

\begin{equation}\label{4.2.10}
\begin{split}
dV_{\varphi(t)}^i& = \frac{v_i}{4}(q^{i,i+1})^2\gamma_tdt+q^{i,i+1}\sqrt{V^i_{\varphi(t)}}\sqrt{\gamma_t}dW_t^{i+1}\\
& = \frac{v_i}{4}(q^{i,i+1})^2d\varphi(t)+q^{i,i+1}\sqrt{V^i_{\varphi(t)}}dU_{\gamma(t)}^{i+1},%\sqrt{\gamma_t}dW_t^{i+1}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
$$
dU_{\varphi(t)}^{i+1} = \sqrt{\gamma_t}dW_t^{i+1,}
$$
for $t\in[0,T]$ and $i\in\{0,1\}$. Using \eqref{6.8} the quadratic variation of $U^{i+1}$ is given by

\begin{equation}\label{4.2.11}
\langle U^{i+1}\rangle_t = \int_0^t\gamma sds = \varphi(t)
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$ and thus $U^{i+1}$ is a Wiener process in $\varphi-$time, $i\in\{0,1\}$. Consequently, in the new $\varphi-$time scale $V^i$ is a squared Bessel  process of dimension $v_i$ that does not depend on the random scaling  process $\gamma$.\\
Using %\eqref{4.1},
 \eqref{4.2.1}, \eqref{6.8} and \eqref{4.2.9} the benchmarked fair price $\tilde{c}_{T,K}(t,\varphi(t), V^0_{\varphi(t)}, V^1_{\varphi(t)},\gamma_t) = \hat{c}_{T,K}(t,D_t^0,D_t^1,\gamma_t)$ of a European call can also be expressed in the form

\begin{equation}\label{6.12}
\begin{split}
& \tilde{c}_{T,K}(t,\varphi(t),V^0_{\varphi(t)},V^1_{\varphi(t)},\gamma_t) = \\
&~E\bigg(\bigg(\frac{1}{B_T^1\bigg(V^1_{\gamma(T)}\bigg)^{\frac{v_1}{2}-1}} - \frac{K}{B_T^2\bigg(V^2_{\gamma(T)}\bigg)^{\frac{v_2}{2}-1}}\bigg)^+\bigg|\bigg), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$.\\
\noindent
\par Consider the filtrations $(\mathcal{A}^1_t)_{t\geq 0}$ and  $(\mathcal{A}^2_t)_{t\geq 0}$ generated by the independent Wiener process $W^1$ and $W^2$, respectively, together with the filtration $(\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ generated by the Wiener process $\tilde{W}$. The filtration $(\mathcal{A}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ apppearing in \eqref{6.12} can be defined as the joint filtration of $(\mathcal{A}^1_t)_{t\geq 0}, (\mathcal{A}_t^2)_{t\geq 0}$ and $(\bar{\mathcal{A}_t})_{t\geq 0}$. That is
$$
\mathcal{A}_t  = \mathcal{A}_t^1\otimes \mathcal{A}_t^2\otimes\bar{\mathcal{A}}_t,
$$
for $t\in[0,T]$. Therefore, $\mathcal{A}_t^\star$ contains all of the information regarding the full evolution of the random scaling process $\gamma$ over the time interval $[0,T]$.\\
\par The conditional expectation \eqref{6.12} %for the benchmarked fair price of a European call can now be rewritten in the form
for the benchmarked fair price of a European call can now be rewritten as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{6.13}
\tilde{c}_{T,K}(t,\varphi(t), V^0_{\varphi(t)}, V^1_{\varphi(t)},\gamma_t) = E(c^\star_{\varphi(T),T,K}(t,\varphi(t),V^1_{\varphi(t)},V^2_{\varphi(2)})|\mathcal{A}_t).   
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{6.14}
c^\star_{\varphi(T),T,K}(t,\varphi(t), V^1_{\varphi(t)}, V^2_{\varphi(t)}) = E\bigg(\bigg(\frac{1}{B_T^1(V^{-1}_{\varphi(T)})^{\frac{v_1}{2} - 1}} - \frac{K}{B_T^2(V^{-1}_{\varphi(T)})^{\frac{v_1}{2} - 1}}\bigg)^+\bigg|\mathcal{A}_t^\star\bigg), 
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$.]\\
\par For simplicity, we will use the model formulation with $\varrho^1 = \varrho^2 = 0$. Then for fixed values $\varphi(t)$ and $\varphi(T)$ the function $c^\star_{\varphi(T),T,K}(t,\varphi(t),V^1_{\varphi(t)})$ can be calculated using the known transition densities of the squared Bessel processes $V^1$ and $V^2$. To approximate \eqref{6.13} we will use the following moment expansion
\begin{equation}\label{6.15}
\begin{split}
E&(c^\star_{\varphi(T),T,K}(t,\varphi(t),V^1_{\varphi(t)},V^2_{\varphi(t)})|\mathcal{A}_t) \approx c^\star_{\tau,T,K}(t,\varphi(t),V^1_{\varphi(t)},V^2_{\varphi(t)})|_{\tau = E(\varphi(T)|\mathcal{A}_t)}\\
&+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \tau^2}c^\star_{\tau,T,K}(t,\varphi(t), V^1_{\varphi(t)}, V^2_{\varphi(t)})|_{\tau = E(\varphi(T)|\mathcal{A}_t)}E((\varphi(T) - E(\varphi(T)|\mathcal{A}_t))^2|\mathcal{A}_t),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$. This expression requires an estimate of the conditional variance $E((\varphi(T) - E(\varphi(T)|\mathcal{A}_T))^2|\mathcal{A}_t)$. Fortunately, this can be conveniently approximated using a one-dimensional coupled system of PDEs. For this purpose we define a function $\tau_1:[0,T]\times (0,\infty)^2\rightarrow (0,\infty)$ by

\begin{equation}\label{6.16}
\tau_1(t,\gamma_t,\varphi(t)) = E(\varphi(T)|\mathcal{A}_t),
\end{equation}
for $t\in[0,T]$. Using the Kolmogov backward equation \eqref{4.4} and \eqref{6.8}, this function satisifies the PDE

\begin{equation}\label{6.17}
\frac{\partial\tau_1(t,\gamma,\varphi)}{\partial t}+a(t,\gamma) \frac{\partial\tau_1(t,\gamma,\varphi)}{\partial \gamma}+\frac{1}{2}b^2(t,\gamma) \frac{\partial^2\tau_1(t,\gamma,\varphi)}{\partial \gamma^2}+\gamma \frac{\partial\tau_1(t,\gamma,\varphi)}{\partial \varphi} = 0, %+a(t,\gamma)
\end{equation}
for $(t,\gamma,\varphi)\in(0,T)\times(0,\infty)^2$ with terminal condition
\begin{equation}\label{6.18}
\tau_1(t,\gamma,\varphi) = \varphi,
\end{equation}
for $(\gamma,\varphi)\in(0,\infty)^2$.\\
The solution to this two-dimensional PDE is given by
$$
\tau_1(t,\gamma,\varphi) = \tau_{1,0}(t,\gamma)+\varphi\tau_{1,1}(t,\gamma),
$$
where $\tau_{1,0}:[0,T]\times (0,\infty)\rightarrow (0,\infty)$ and $\tau_{1,1}:[0,T]\times (0,\infty)\rightarrow (0,\infty)$ are functions that satisfy the coupled system of PDEs

\begin{equation}\label{6.19}
\frac{\partial \tau_{1,0}(t,\gamma)}{\partial t}+a(t,\gamma) \frac{\partial \tau_{1,0}(t,\gamma)}{\partial \gamma}+\frac{1}{2}b^2(t,\gamma) \frac{\partial^2\tau_{1,0}(t,\gamma)}{\partial \gamma^2}+\gamma\tau_{1,1}(t,\gamma) = 0,%a(t,\gamma)
\end{equation}
and 

\begin{equation}\label{4.2.20}
\frac{\partial \tau_{1,1}(t,\gamma)}{\partial t}+a(t,\gamma) \frac{\partial \tau_{1,1}(t,\gamma)}{\partial \gamma}+\frac{1}{2}b^2(t,\gamma) \frac{\partial^2\tau_{1,1}(t,\gamma)}{\partial \gamma^2} = 0,%+\gamma\tau_{1,1}(t,\gamma) = 0,%a(t,\gamma)
\end{equation}
for $(t,\gamma)\in(0,T)\times (0,\infty)$ with terminal condition

\begin{equation}\label{4.2.21}
\tau_{1,0}(T,\gamma) = 0
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}\label{4.2.22}
\tau_{1,1}(T,\gamma) = 1,
\end{equation}
for $\gamma\in(0,\infty)$. A similar valuation procedure can be used to approximate the function $\tau_2:[0,T]\times (0,\infty)^2\rightarrow(0,\infty)$ given by

\begin{equation}\label{6.23}
\tau_2(t,\gamma_t,\varphi(t)) = E(\varphi^2(T)|\mathcal{A}_t).
\end{equation}

for $t \in [0,T].$ The functions $T1$ and $T2$ given in \eqref{6.16}  and \eqref{6.23},
respectively, are needed to approximate the conditional variance appearing in
the expansion \eqref{6.15}. For all of the numerical results described in this section
the above expansion method was successfully used.

\par To illustrate the type of pricing effects that can be obtained, Fig. 1 shows a term
structure of implied volatilities as a function of the strike $K$ and maturity date $T$
generated for the above MMM. The default parameters used were $v_0 = v_1 =4.0,$\\
scaling levels $q^{0,1} = q^{=1,2} = 0.2$, short rates $r_t^0 = r_t^1 = 0.05$ initial values $D_0^0 = D_0^1 = 1.0$ and maturity date $T$ = 1.0. For the random scaling process $\gamma$ the default parameters used were $\varrho = 3,~g = 2,~\eta = 0.048$ and $\beta = 0.6$ with initial values $\xi_0 = 1.0$ and $\gamma_0 = 1.0.$

Implied volatilities were calculated for the numerical results shown here by using both domestic and foreign zero coupon bonds to infer the discount factor used in the Black–Scholes formula for exchange rate call and put options. This ensures that the implied volatilities calculated for call and put options with the same strike price and maturity date are identical.\\

Inspection of Fig. 1 shows that for the default parameters used the at-the- money implied volatilities increase gradually as the maturity date
increases. The implied volatility smile curvature, evident in Figure \ref{image3}, is due to
the scaling process $\gamma$. This type of shape for the term structure of implied volatilities is  typical for observed currency options.

For a fixed maturity date $T$ = 0.25, Figure \ref{image4} shows implied volatilities for European call options as a function of the scaling level $q^{1,2}$. Here the normalization condition $q^{0,1}+q^{1,2} = 0.4$ is imposed to ensure that the at-the-money implied volatilities are approximately the same for different values of $q^{1,2}$. Note that by changing the magnitude of $q^{1,2}$ relative to $q^{0,1}$ the implied volatility curve can be changed from a predominately negatively skewed smile to a predominantly positively skewed smile.

This is generally only obtained for a variety of stochastic volatility models by using different values for the degree of correlation between the driving Wiener processes for the models. It is obtained more naturally and directly here by employing the %scaling levels $q0,1$ and $q1,2$.

lower dimension produces more curvature for the implied volatility smile. For
higher dimensions some degree of curvature is still present. This is due to the
natural curvature produced by the random scaling process $\gamma$.
